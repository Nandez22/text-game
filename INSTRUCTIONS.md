# INSTRUCTIONS


If you do not have pygame installed alreat, do so.

You can do it by running
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

You can also find the most up to date install info on [Pygame's Wiki](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)


Once the correct packages have been installed you can start the program by running [Main.py](JumpGame/Innards/Main.py).
*(This is assuming I have not created an installer at this point)*
