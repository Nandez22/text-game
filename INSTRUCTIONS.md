# INSTRUCTIONS

## Python
While this may seem a little redundent, you need python installed to run this.
You can find the install information on [Python's Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Pygame
If you do not have pygame installed already, it's required to run this "game".

You can do so by running
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
## Running The Game
You can also find the most up to date install info on [Pygame's Wiki](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)


Once the correct packages have been installed you can start the program by running [Main.py](JumpGame/Innards/Main.py).
*(This is assuming I have not created an installer at this point)*
