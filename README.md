# text-game "Thing"
 Unfortunatley this thing lacks and identity or spelling.

This is our project, I understand that a README seems a touch redundent, but I figured you might want to recieve your explination outside of my nonsensical python comments.
In full transparency the 'game' aspect of this project is fully tutorial based. Before you bring down the hammer on our grade, I'd like to note that this was only done to give this project a sense of 'completion'... The menus (which are original) cover the entire rubric. Meaning that without any spec of actual game code we have fully fufilled the reqs for this project. Just wanted to add something shinny for shinny thing sake.

I digress, Its a menu system with a small game attached. I spent too long making buttons and dropdown menus to even think of making something remotly appealing so we are adding it as a last minute \**Jazz hands\** pizzaz \**end Jazz hands\**. 

I'd also like to quickly mention that the code is messy, very messy. A big problem I ran into was myself and learning. While my more recent code looks much better, certain elements were made when I was unaware of how certain game functions worked, resulting in messy workarounds to avoid redoing everything.

The rest of my wonderful explination minus Jazz Hands are in the hundreds of comments in the code.

Thanks,

# INSTRUCTIONS

## Python
While this may seem a little redundent, you need python installed to run this.  
You can find the install information on [Python's Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

## Pygame
If you do not have pygame installed already, it's required to run this "game".  

You can do so by running:  
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user  
```
## Running The Game
You can also find the most up to date install info on [Pygame's Wiki](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)  


Once the correct packages have been installed you can start the program by running [Main.py](JumpGame/Innards/Main.py).  
*(This is assuming I have not created an installer at this point)*
