# text-game "Thing"
 Unfortunatley this thing lacks and identity or spelling.

This is our project, I understand that a README seems a touch redundent, but I figured you might want to recieve your explination outside of my nonsensical python comments.
In full transparency the 'game' aspect of this project is fully tutorial based. Before you bring down the hammer on our grade, I'd like to note that this was only done to give this project a sense of 'completion'... The menus (which are origional) cover the entire rubric. Meaning that without any spec of actual game code we have fully fufilled the reqs for this project. Just wanted to add something shinny for shinny thing sake.

I digress, Its a menu system with a small game attached. I spent too long making buttons and dropdown menus to even think of making something remotly appealing so we are adding it as a last minute **Jazz hands** pizzaz **end Jazz hands**. 

The rest of my wonderful explination minus Jazz Hands are in the hundreds of comments in the code.

Thanks,
 ~ Joe
